# **System Design Document: Scalable Microservice-Based E-Commerce Application**

## **1. Overview**
This document outlines the architecture of a scalable microservice-based e-commerce application. The system consists of independent services that handle user authentication, product management, and order processing. It is designed to be resilient, highly available, and scalable to accommodate increasing user demand.

## **2. Architecture Design**
The application follows a microservices architecture where each service is independently deployable, scalable, and communicates via RESTful APIs or messaging queues.

### **2.1 High-Level Architecture**

- **User Service** → Manages user registration, authentication, and authorization.
- **Product Service** → Handles the product catalog management.
- **Order Service** → Manages order placements, payments, and transaction processing.
- **API Gateway** → A centralized entry point for all incoming requests.
- **Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)** → Ensures asynchronous event-driven communication for tasks like email notifications and order updates.
- **Database Layer (MySQL)** → Stores persistent data for users, products, and orders.
- **Caching Layer (Redis)** → Enhances the performance of frequently queried data by caching responses.
- **Logging & Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana, Winston)** → Provides observability for tracking system performance and errors.

## **3. Diagrams**

### **3.1 Component Diagram**
The component diagram illustrates the interaction between the various microservices and external systems like databases, API Gateway, and messaging queue.

```bash
graph TD;
    A[User] -->|Registers/Login| B(User Service)
    A -->|Views Products| C(Product Service)
    A -->|Places Order| D(Order Service)
    B -->|JWT Authentication| E[Auth System]
    B -->|Stores Data| F[(MySQL Database)]
    C -->|Manages Product Listings| F
    D -->|Manages Orders| F
    D -->|Sends Notifications| G[Message Queue (RabbitMQ/Kafka)]
    G -->|Triggers Emails| H[Email Service]
```

### **3.2 Sequence Diagram**
The sequence diagram below illustrates the user registration process and its interactions with various services.

```bash
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant API Gateway
    participant UserService
    participant Database
    participant MessageQueue
    participant EmailService

    User->>API Gateway: POST /register
    API Gateway->>UserService: Forward request
    UserService->>Database: Store user details
    Database-->>UserService: Confirmation
    UserService->>MessageQueue: Publish "User Registered" event
    MessageQueue->>EmailService: Consume event & send email
    EmailService-->>User: "Welcome" email sent
    UserService-->>API Gateway: Return success response
    API Gateway-->>User: Registration successful
```

### **3.3 Deployment Diagram**
The deployment diagram outlines how services are deployed within a Kubernetes cluster, using Docker containers for each service.

```bash
graph TD;
    subgraph Kubernetes Cluster
        subgraph API Layer
            A[API Gateway]
        end
        subgraph Services
            B[User Service]
            C[Product Service]
            D[Order Service]
        end
        subgraph Infrastructure
            E[(MySQL Database)]
            F[Redis Cache]
            G[Message Queue (RabbitMQ)]
        end
    end
```

## **4. Service Descriptions**

### **4.1 User Service**
- **Responsibilities**: Handles user registration, authentication, and JWT-based authorization.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /register` → Registers a new user.
  - `POST /login` → Authenticates a user.
  - `GET /users/:id` → Retrieves user details.
- **Database**: Stores user data in MySQL.
- **Security**: Password hashing using bcrypt and JWT for user authentication.

### **4.2 Product Service**
- **Responsibilities**: Manages the product catalog, including adding, updating, and deleting products.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /products` → Adds a new product.
  - `GET /products/:id` → Fetches product details.
  - `PUT /products/:id` → Updates product details.
  - `DELETE /products/:id` → Deletes a product.
- **Database**: Stores product information in MySQL.

### **4.3 Order Service**
- **Responsibilities**: Manages orders, payments, and transactions.
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /orders` → Places an order.
  - `GET /orders/:id` → Fetches order details.
  - `PUT /orders/:id/cancel` → Cancels an order.
- **Database**: Stores order records in MySQL.

## **5. Communication Between Services**

### **5.1 API Gateway**
- The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all incoming client requests.
- It routes requests to the appropriate microservices, handles authentication, and can perform rate limiting.
- **Example Routes**:
  ```bash
  POST /api/users/register → User Service
  POST /api/users/login → User Service
  GET /api/products/:id → Product Service
  POST /api/orders → Order Service
  ```

### **5.2 Inter-Service Communication**
Each microservice communicates with others using **HTTP REST APIs** for direct service-to-service calls. Below is a table showing how different services interact:

| **Service**     | **Consumer**       | **Method** | **Endpoint**        |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------|---------------------|
| User Service    | Product Service    | `GET`      | `/api/users/:id`    |
| Order Service   | Product Service    | `GET`      | `/api/products/:id` |
| Order Service   | User Service       | `GET`      | `/api/users/:id`    |

## **6. Data Consistency & Fault Tolerance**

### **6.1 Data Consistency**
- The system ensures data consistency using **ACID** properties for transactions.
- **Two-Phase Commit (2PC)** can be used for distributed transactions.
- For asynchronous operations, **eventual consistency** will be applied.

### **6.2 Fault Tolerance**

#### **1. Handling Failures & Timeouts**
- To prevent cascading failures, we will implement:
  - **Retries & Circuit Breaker** patterns to prevent overloading services.
  - **Timeouts** to avoid long waiting periods for responses.
  - **Fallback Mechanism** to serve cached data when services like the Product Service are unavailable.

```typescript
import axios from 'axios';
import CircuitBreaker from 'opossum';

const options = {
  timeout: 3000,  // 3s timeout
  errorThresholdPercentage: 50,  // Trip breaker if 50% requests fail
  resetTimeout: 5000  // Retry after 5s
};

const breaker = new CircuitBreaker(() => axios.get('http://product-service/api/products/1'), options);
breaker.fallback(() => ({ message: "Product service unavailable, please try again later" }));
breaker.fire()
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

#### **2. Ensuring Security**
- **JWT Authentication**: Users must include a JWT token in the `Authorization` header of every API request.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a specified time period.

```typescript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100  // Limit each IP to 100 requests per window
});

app.use(limiter);
```

## **7. Scalability**

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Each microservice can scale independently, with multiple instances deployed behind a load balancer to handle increased traffic.
- **Database Scaling**: Use **read replicas** to handle read-heavy operations and ensure high availability.
- **Caching**: **Redis** will be used to reduce database queries by caching frequently accessed data.

---

## **8. Conclusion**

This design outlines a scalable, fault-tolerant e-commerce platform that leverages microservices, asynchronous communication, and robust security measures. The system ensures high availability, fast response times, and easy maintainability. It is designed to handle future growth efficiently and can be extended as needed.

---

### **Next Steps:**
- **Implementation**: Build each service and deploy them on the Kubernetes cluster.
- **Integration**: Implement communication between services and integrate the API Gateway.
- **Testing**: Perform load testing, security testing, and fault tolerance simulations.
